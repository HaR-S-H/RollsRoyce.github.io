            <p>The Rolls-Royce Phantom is a full-sized luxury saloon manufactured by Rolls-Royce Motor Cars. It is the eighth and current generation of the
                 Rolls-Royce Phantom, debuting in 2017, and the second launched by Rolls-Royce under BMW ownership. It is offered in two wheelbase lengths.
                  This is the current flagship model made by Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.The Phantom was unveiled by livestream on 27 July 2017.[9]
                  It made its public debut at a special exhibition Rolls-Royce held in London two days later on 29 July. The event, dubbed "The
                   Great Eight Phantoms", took place at Bonhams auction house in Mayfair. The exhibition gathered a noteworthy Phantom from each
                    generation, from Fred Astaire's Phantom I to subsequent models driven by royalty, or made famous by celebrities, including John
                     Lennon's Romany gypsy wagon-style painted Phantom V.
                     The Phantom VIII's styling has been described as an evolution of the Phantom VII's as it bears most of the design features of its predecessor.
                     Like its predecessor, the Phantom VIII has a short front overhang and upright front end, a long bonnet and set-back passenger compartment as well
                      as a long wheelbase and a flowing rear end.It also uses rear-opening "coach doors". For the first time on a Phantom, Rolls-Royce's trademark 
                      "Parthenon" radiator grille is integrated into the surrounding bodywork.Design

                        radiator grille is integrated into the surrounding bodywork.The Phantom is fitted with self-levelling air springs and electronically controlled dampers
                         front and rear. It uses a double wishbone front axle and a 5-link rear axle.It is also equipped with active anti-roll bars.
                        The suspension system is linked to a stereo camera mounted behind the windscreen. This scans the road ahead and preconfigures
                         the spring and damper rates, and the anti-roll bars, so as to improve ride quality. The system, dubbed the "Flagbearer" by Rolls-Royce,
                          operates at speeds of up to 100 km/h (62 mph)
                        The Phantom is the first Rolls-Royce to be fitted with four-wheel steering. The system turns the rear wheels counter to the front wheels through 
                        a maximum of 3Â° at speeds lower than 60 km/h (37 mph) to ********improve manoeuvrability.********<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Phantom_(eighth_generation)" target="_blank">Read more</a> </p>
