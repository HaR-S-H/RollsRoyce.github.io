                The Rolls-Royce Cullinan is a full-sized luxury sport utility vehicle (SUV) manufactured by Rolls-Royce Motor Cars as the
                 brand's first all-wheel drive vehicle. It is named after the Cullinan Diamond, the largest gem-quality rough diamond ever discovered.
The Cullinan sits above the Ghost and below the Phantom in Rolls-Royce's line, with a starting price in the United States of approximately US$ 325,000 (£ 255,000). 
It was unveiled in May 2018 at the Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este. In the US, it is not exempt from the Energy Tax Act because it is classified as a station wagon rather than an SUV.
In 2017 it was reported that a design was in the works and that the name would be Cullinan. This was due to its competitors such as Bentley and Lamborghini venturing into the SUV business
 with the Bentayga and the Urus respectively. At the 2015 Frankfurt Auto Show, Rolls Royce's CEO Torsten Müller-Ötvös said that the SUV will be revealed in 2018 and be on the market in 2019.
The name "Cullinan" was confirmed by Rolls Royce on 13 February 2018. It is named after the Cullinan diamond, the largest diamond ever found at 3100 carats.
According to own Statement of BMW AG, Rolls Royce and similar institutions, this generation of automobile with combustion engine has a preview to an end until 2030, due the company only producing electric models.
