                The Rolls-Royce Wraith is a full-size luxury car/grand tourer manufactured by Rolls-Royce Motor Cars and based on the chassis 
                of the Rolls-Royce Ghost, shares its name with the 1938 model by the original Rolls-Royce company.
The body style is a two-door pillar-less coupe with iconic suicide doors, where all side windows can roll down like in a convertible. This body style was popular in
 American cars during the 1950s and 1960s, and was known as the hardtop body style, not used by Rolls-Royce since 1955.
 The Rolls-Royce Wraith was built in order to replace the earlier 2-door car model, the Rolls-Royce Phantom Coupé, built on the basis of the Rolls-Royce Ghost, unlike the 
 earlier model which was based on the 7th Generation Rolls-Royce Phantom, the flagship car model of Rolls-Royce Motor cars until the arrival of the 8th Generation. It is the fastest car made by Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.
 The Wraith Black Badge is a special edition of the Wraith which is performance based. Its exterior features are painted black (including the Spirit of Ecstasy), and its interior consists of carbon fibre applications.
In addition, the Black Badge moniker has been applied to the Rolls-Royce Cullinan and the Rolls-Royce Dawn.
Unveiled online alongside the Rolls-Royce Dawn Landspeed in June 2021, the Landspeed Edition is a limited version of the Wraith Black Badge made to pay homage to Captain George E.T. Eyston.
The interior bears new features, such as Eyston's OBE, Military Cross and Chevalier de la Légion.
It is a special edition of the Rolls-Royce Wraith. Deriving from ancient Greek, the name 'Kryptos' refers to all that is concealed.
Designed as a homage to the clandestine world of cryptology, this car's production is limited to 50 units.
